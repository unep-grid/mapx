A message describing this is also shown during language change. This has been done to mitigate the growing issue regarding the lack of contributions for our translation system for technical terms and templates. Contributions are welcome !

         - Better UX with fixes requested in #617, #618, #619

         - Geoserver Async call with email feedback for views and source update. All requests were blocking. It should be a lot faster now
         - Experimental shiny-server removal, as it was interfering with the docker logic when a process was failing. We rely on direct connexion. Traefik should ensure sticky connexion. 
         - Minor changes.
      - Api:
        - Major refactoring:
           - All modules are required using unfied '@mapx/<module>'.

   - Improvement 
    - APP/API
        - Source summary, allow all binnings method to have bounds from a single number in case of very skewed distribution (#596) ; 
    - APP
        - Better modal background : use pseudo-elements. It should avoid having modal siblings still accessible when background is set.
        - Added reverse mode in palette colors.
        - Set icon flash as a module using class. 
        - Added better click visual feedback on views panel - could be ported to the whole app.
        - Refactoring cache / fetch  management for wms and source summary:  
        - Unifiyng TTL and timeout (app side);
        - The button to remove cache has a confirmation step; It will remove all cache and stored data know to MapX. At least, what is accessible by  service workers and localforage; It does not trigger a reload anymore.
        - Source summary for views add a first step, no cached, to get source timestamp. This should avoid issues when the source is modified during a session. 
        - Partial rewrite of main dot templates: more flexibility to partial view UI loading. 
        - Filter tools are now generated only on demand. They need cached response of summary. Should be invalidated if the source or the view change.
 
- <a href='https://github.com/unep-grid/map-x-mgl/tree/1.7.2' target='_blank'>1.7.2</a>

   - Improvement
      - APP/API
        - Added application_name parameter in api and app. This parameter is usefull to perform request on DB `SELECT usename, application_name, state FROM pg_stat_activity`.
        - Removed references to a master connexion from the app : a single pool of connexion is used instead of two. Access to a master DB in case of DB clustering could still be made using `NO LOAD BALANCE` header in queries string.
        - Rewrote mapx specific wrappers around library pool functions.
        - Using onStop shiny function to launch cleaning steps should guarantee that no pool remains un-closed, and therefore avoiding memory leaks. Previous approach was made using the .Last command which is fired at the end of the R session. Maybe a combination of the two approaches could even be better.
